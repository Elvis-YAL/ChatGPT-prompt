# In this project
There's 152 data from ChatGPT prompt.

For text analysis, we have multiple methods to choose from. Below are some analysis methods in my notebook:

#### 1. Keyword Extraction

We can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to extract the most frequently occurring keywords from the prompt.

#### 2. Topic Modeling

Furthermore, we can employ topic modeling techniques, such as LDA, to explore what topics users are most concerned about.

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis

We can assess whether the majority of user inputs are positive, negative, or neutral.

#### 4. N-gram Analysis

This analysis can reveal the most frequently occurring phrases or sequences of words.

#### 5. Specific Needs Analysis

If the prompt usually contains specific needs or questions, we can look for these specific needs or questions.
